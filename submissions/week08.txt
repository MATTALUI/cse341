6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
- The assignment was kind of disappointing. It also seems like it's not that important and it even says so. I would have rather not had this assignment at all, and instead had more time to work on the team project stuff we want to implement, since it seems like that's higher value.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

- Pretty Bootstrap styles
