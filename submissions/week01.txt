1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/MATTALUI/cse341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
All elements of the application are running:
- can be started with `npm run prove01`
- root serves us welcome message with form conatining "username"
- submitting form hits /create-users and adds users to dummy list of users
- visiting /users shows the list of users who are registered
- expressjs is used
- ejs
- looks nice
- users can submit additional information

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None. Alls well!

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Setting up a new script as a way to run an assignment-specific server.
It's a lot more clever than having to know which directory to be in to run the server.
Also, EJS was new for me!

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I think clarity in the assignment would have made this smoother and a more effective learning experience.
There were two different rubrics with different criteria for "above and beyond" and it was hard to know
what is actually expected at a glance.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
  5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
  - EJS is used and pages look professional
  - Multiple pieces of data can be submitted for a user
